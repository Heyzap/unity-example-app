/**
 *  Use this class to request an update from Fyber's Virtual Currency Server (VCS) product regarding how much currency a user has earned since the last time you asked.
 
 *  @discussion Virtual currency can be earned via OfferWall and Rewarded Video views from Fyber. If you only want to use this class for OfferWall rewarding (most publishers) and not for RV rewarding, make sure to set the rewards up on the Fyber dashboard such that RVs don't produce any virtual currency, or at least not the same currency as offerwall interactions so you can tell the difference. Otherwise, you may end up rewarding users twice for RV views from the Fyber ad network.
