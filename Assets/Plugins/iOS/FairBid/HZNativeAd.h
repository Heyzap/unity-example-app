#pragma mark - Accessing the underlying JSON data

/**

#pragma mark - Reporting Events

/**
 *  Call this method when you show an individual ad. If you are showing multiple ads at once, you can report multiple impressions at once using `HZNativeAdCollection`'s `reportImpressionOnAllAds` API (this reduces network requests).
 *
 *  @warning Do not reuse an `HZNativeAd` after showing it to the user. This will cause your impressions to be underreported. Instead fetch new ads using `HZNativeAdController.`
 */

/**
 *  When the user clicks the ad, call this method to present an SKStoreProductViewController for that ad. This method will handle reporting the click to Heyzap. This method must be called on the main queue.
 *
 *  @param viewController The view controller which should present the `SKStoreProductViewController`.
 *  @param storeDelegate  The delegate for the `SKStoreProductViewController`. The delegate should dismiss the `SKStoreProductViewController` when `productViewControllerDidFinish:` is called on it.
 *  @param completion     In rare cases, `SKStoreProductViewController` will fail to load the App Store modally, as described in `loadProductWithParameters:completionBlock:`. We may also choose not to use the `SKStoreProductViewController` under certain error conditions. This block's `result` will be set to `YES` if the `SKStoreProductViewController` was presented, or `NO` otherwise. The `error` may contain more information on the failure when `result` is `NO`. If we do not load a `SKStoreProductViewController` successfully, we will open the App Store App directly using `[UIApplication openURL:]` instead.
 *
 *  @return Returns the SKStoreProductViewController, if we create one, and otherwise returns `nil`. Note that even if we create an `SKStoreProductViewController`, it won't necessarily be presented (see the description of the `completion` parameter).
 
 It's recommended that you display a loading spinner before calling this method, in case the app store takes some time to load. You can dismiss the loading spinner in the `completion` block of this method.
